Reset all VM connectivity 
0. Download the VMware vSphere PowerCLI to a windows VM 
1. Connect-VIServer -Server 10.201.35.4 -User root -Password Cisc0123
2. Get-VM | Get-NetworkAdapter | Set-NetworkAdapter -NetworkName “VM Network”   -Confirm:$false (# if we have "-Connect:$false" on the CLI, then we need to ssh to the ESXi host to connect the vcenter VM's nic) 
3. Get-VMHost | Get-VMHostNetworkAdapter -VMKernel | ? {$_.PortgroupName -eq "vtep"} | Remove-VMHostNetworkAdapter
 
4. Remove the ACI created DVS from Inventory->Networking

Reset APIC: 
1. Go to "VM Networking" and "Policies"
2. Expand on policies--> vmware--> right click and delete the VM switch polices
3. Click on fabric--> Inventory--> select "topology"  
4. from the topology identify the leaf where APIC is NOT connected and decommision the switch and select "remove from           controller". (using putty open console and wait for about 5 mins)	

Note:- The switch that connects the APIC HAS to be the last device to be decommisioned from the setup.

5. now decommission other switches using step 4. 

   
6. Using kvm connect to "APIC console", login with your credentials and issue 'eraseconfig setup' command.
(Use SOL - ssh to CIMC "show sol" if it's not enabled, enable SOL as following:
scope sol
set enabled yes
set baud-rate 115200
set comport com0
commit
exit
)
